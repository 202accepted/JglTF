# jgltf-browser - A Java glTF browser 

A *very* simple utility for browsing 
[glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/) data.

**Note:** This application is still subject to change.

Build with

to create a simple, standalone application.


An overview of the current functionality:

* Drag-and-drop glTF links or files into the browser window
* Basic browsing by right-clicking references and selecting the referenced
