**Note:** These libraries are still subject to change.

## What is glTF?

The following image gives an overview of glTF:

The libraries currently available here are

* [jgltf-impl](https://github.com/javagl/JglTF/tree/master/jgltf-impl) : 
  A very simple set of classes that represent glTF data, auto-generated 
  from the glTF JSON schema
* [jgltf-model](https://github.com/javagl/JglTF/tree/master/jgltf-model) : 
  A library built on top of `jgltf-impl` that offers functionality for 
  reading glTF data and accessing the associated data in a form that is more
  convenient for the use in Java
* [jgltf-browser](https://github.com/javagl/JglTF/tree/master/jgltf-browser) : 
  A **very** simple standalone application that allows loading glTF from files
  or URLs via drag-and-drop, and offers a basic functionality for
  browsing though the glTF structure, by navigating through the references
  inside the glTF, and showing the images, shader code and accessor data
  in a structured form.
